# TypeScript Definitions #

If you are a phaser dev then reference the `phaser.d.ts` in your project. 

Please use TypeScript 1.4

- `phaser.d.ts` contains a reference to `pixi.d.ts` and so both these files must remain siblings in the same directory.
- `pixi.d.ts` has no dependencies and can be used by pixi devs standalone.
